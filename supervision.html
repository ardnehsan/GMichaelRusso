          <div class="clr"></div>
          <h3>Foundations of the Discrimination Model</h3>
          <p>It is my belief that a firm foundation in supervision comes from a combination of clinical
            and professional experiences. It is through these experiences, which I use in concert with the
            discrimination model of supervision, to serve my current supervisees at the University
            Counseling Center at the University of Mississippi. Bernard (1979) describes the discrimination
            model as the exploration of supervision foci (i.e., intervention, conceptualization, and
            personalization) through use of the particular roles of teacher, counselor, and consultant. The
            discrimination model was broadened to include professional performance, which a supervisee
            might require support in as they expand and explore their professional identity (Lanning, 1986).
            This process of ebbing and flowing between supervision roles and foci is what some
            might consider to be a deeply moving dance. Initially, this dance allows the supervisor to act as a
            leader to support and teach the supervisee a sequence of steps as they practice the art of
            counseling and deepen the development of their counseling identity. However, as the supervisee
            develops and strengthens their skills, the supervisor begins to take a less active role and follow
            the leadership of the supervisee. This process allows the supervisee to develop the confidence
            and skills which promote their clinical practice and a strong counselor identity.
            Akin to our work with any population, there is a large degree of variation in confidence
            levels and previous clinical experience. As such, I recognize the need to accurately assess and
            remain flexible to the needs and the development of my supervisees. This adjustment occurs as I
            shift my supervisory roles and adjust the foci of supervision sessions.</p>

          <h3><span>Discrimination Model in Action</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>An example of this comes from my supervisee, which I will identify as “Z”. Z is a
            masters-level counselor-in-training and has had a fair amount of clinical experience through their
            place of employment. Upon meeting Z for our first supervision meeting, it was apparent that Z
            was confident in their clinical practice and had a strong degree of self-awareness. Z identified
            that they often conceptualize clients from a person-centered theoretical orientation. Additionally,
            Z shared areas that they wished to grow in personally as well as professionally and understood
            the limitations of the supervisory relationship. Upon reviewing video recordings of Z, I noted the
            empathetic presence, strong level of care, and their ability to quickly establish a working
            relationship with their client. I also noted that Z seemed to struggle a bit in terms of using
            themselves in the room. As we met for supervision, I asked Z to recall how they were feeling in
            the room with the client as we watched tape from their most recent session. Z went on to
            describe initial feelings of confusion which built to a slight degree of frustration with the client.
            While verbalizing this experience, Z began to recognize how inauthentic they were being during
            session. This realization facilitated growth for Z who was successfully able to change this
            approach in future sessions. Furthermore, Z reported that they found counseling to be a more
            rewarding experience and they felt like they had a stronger clinical relationship with the client
            that they served.
            This example of Z is one which I reflect upon because, for me, it served to validate the
            use of the counselor role to explore the foci of personalization in the discrimination model. This
            experience also taught me about how powerful reflection could be in the promotion of a
            supervisee’s growth. As a supervisor, I have two goals for my supervisees. The first is that they
            are able to strengthen their identity as a counselor. The second is that they feel more confident in
            their ability to empower their clients to identify and achieve the clinically appropriate goals
            which they set for themselves.</p>
