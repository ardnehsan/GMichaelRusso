          <h2>Teaching</h2>
          <h3>Philosophy</h3>
          <p>It is my belief that research is the voice of our profession. Research is conducted in a
            style which simultaneously serves the function of advancing the counseling profession whilst
            honoring those whom we serve. As such, it is my belief that research, especially that which is
            driven by clinical practice and is rooted in ethical principles, is one of the most crucial
            components of our profession. Furthermore, it is my belief that research should promote social
            justice. This inherently occurs as we decrease the disparity between clients who have resources
            to take part in counseling and those who do not. All too-often, many of us within the profession
            forget that counseling is a privilege. Often times, those who can gain the most from this
            additional support cannot afford the costs demanded of them. As such, we address a need in our
            community when we conduct research which provides those who cannot afford the luxury of
            counseling with free or a reduction to the cost of services.
            Furthermore, their voice, which is present in both quantitative and qualitative
            methodologies, establishes a platform of advocacy and assists in stamping-out stigma which
            adversely effects mental health. Principles of social justice and equity do not stop when we
            receive notification of acceptance for publication. It is my belief that publication is only part of
            this process. The next stage is to share this information with our colleagues through
            presentations. While presenting, we invite feedback and exert a challenge to our colleagues to
            carry the torch forward by providing services to additional populations. Additionally, we
            challenge our colleagues to evaluate the efficacy of our approach while providing services to
            individuals/groups which have a unique set of needs and worldviews. Ultimately, research
            informs our practice, establishes the foundation for our presentations/teachings, and informs
            policies which govern our collective livelihood.</p>
            <h3>Practice</h3>
            <p>This philosophical approach to research has been the crux of my academic practices to
              date. An example of this philosophy in action comes from the development of an article that I
              collaborated with my colleagues on in 2015. The origins of this article stemmed from the
              recognition that there was a high frequency of individuals who were seeking support in
              managing symptoms of anxiety at our university-based training clinic. This clinic provided
              masters-level counselors in-training with support as they honed their counseling and
              neurofeedback skills. Upon recognizing the need of our community, we sought and received IRB
              approval and established our research study. We wrote-up the findings of the pilot phase of our
              study and were able to successfully publish the article. For many of the authors, this was the end
              of the process. However, given my philosophy of client advocacy, I felt compelled to continue to
              share our findings with the hopes that our methodology would inspire clinical researchers to see
              if they were able to promote growth in their environments. Upon concluding one of these
              presentations, I was approached by a professor at a university which, at the time, was located in
              the part of the country which had the largest density individuals who experienced opioid
              dependency. Through conversation, we were able to identify a new population which had a
              significant need and had the backing of previous literature to support a potential study.</p>
              <h3>Research Agenda</h3>
              <p>Moving forward, I aim to build upon my previously conducted research, which largely
                encompasses the use of neuroscience as a tool utilized by counselors to promote client growth.
                The goal of this research is two-fold; firstly, to explore the use of neuroscience as a tool which
                further validates the practice of counseling and; secondly, to explore the efficacy of
                neurofeedback in the treatment of clients’ brain-based clinical goals. Acquisition of grants and
                alternative sources of funding are paramount to the development of this research track. This
                technology will also assist in the development of a neurofeedback training program as well as
                assist in addressing programmatic standards.
                Given the recognition that clinical research is oftentimes costly and time consuming, I
                will actively pursue additional approaches to advance our profession such as the use of
                neuroscience-related meta-analyses. These analyses will further inform future research practices
                by identifying populations which have not been addressed by previous research and address the
                evidence-basis for the use of neuroscience-informed practices.</p>
                <h3>Relevance to the Counseling Profession</h3>
                <p>Danskin and Walters (1973) were the first authors to suggest the use of biofeedback
                  within the practice of counseling. Since then, The American Counseling Association (ACA), The
                  Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP), and
                  the American Mental Health Counselors Association (AMHCA) all address neuroscience
                  through their standards, interest networks, and/or designated space within their official
                  publications. My research agenda seeks to build upon the rich history and institutional support
                  present through ACA, CACREP, and AMHCA to evaluate the efficacy of these practices.
                  Additional evidence of this comes from my intended dissertation topic which seeks to test a
                  randomized, sham-controlled neurofeedback trial within a population of individuals who meet
                  diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. To date, a significant gap in the literature has
                  been the utilization of a sham-controlled neurofeedback design which is based on principles of
                  learning. If successful, this would be the first article to-date which utilizes such a protocol. In
                  terms of policy implications, this research would address the basis which many insurance
                  companies use to deny coverage to individuals who wish to access neurofeedback services
                  offered by trained counselors. Furthermore, the methodology could establish a foundation to
                  further explore the extent to which neurofeedback is beneficial in the reduction of other clinical
                  symptoms.</p>
