          <div class="clr"></div>
          <h3>Leadership Development</h3>
          <p>My leadership identity began to develop early on in my career when I was appointed to
            the position of president of the student psychology club while pursuing my undergraduate
            degree. Upon learning that I was to serve in this role I turned to our faculty advisor, Dr. Mary
            McNaughton-Cassill and sought direction. Each time I asked for guidance, she directed me back
            to the membership that I served. This thought of approaching the membership petrified me
            because, after all, I was appointed to serve them. Despite this fear, I decided to create a survey in
            collaboration with my fellow officers to gather information about what the membership wanted.
            Through the survey of our membership, we noticed that there were two experiences
            which frequently emerged. First, our membership had a desire to pursue a graduate degree, but
            were fearful of the competitive nature of GRE scores. The second, was that many of our
            colleagues identified themselves as Latinx and were literally disowned by their families due to
            their desire to obtain an undergraduate degree. As a privileged white male who has had a large
            level of familial support, I was humbled by the fact that I never had considered these experiences
            that many of my colleagues shared. Collectively we determined that one way that we could serve
            our membership is to work with test prep organizations to negotiate contracts. These contracts
            allowed us to biannually award free GRE test prep courses and provide members with a 40%
            discount on courses/materials. Collectively, these contracts carried a fiscal impact totaling
            $130,000 over a period of 6 years.</p>

          <h3><span>Servant Leadership</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>These experiences taught me two fundamental components of advocacy and leadership.
            First, it is only when you are aware of the needs of those whom you serve that you can truly act
            on their behalf. Second, leadership and advocacy are we and not me. Hill and Friedman (2018)
            identify leadership development in terms of: personal qualities and temperament, mentoring and
            role modeling, cultural awareness and competencies, professional socialization, counseling skill
            development, as well as invitation and encouragement to serve. Upon reflecting on my
            leadership journey to date, I certainly see how each of these areas have contributed to the
            development of my leadership identity. Of these areas, the most significant has been the honor of
            receiving mentorship from: Drs. Gerald A. Juhnke, Thelma Duffey, Eric T. Beeson, Thom Field,
            Richard S. Balkin, and A. Stephen Lenz. Each of these individuals have uniquely shaped and
            contributed to my development and strong passion for the counseling profession. Throughout my
            service at the local, state, regional, national, and international levels, I have carried the servant
            leadership style. This approach is present in my work and commences by a very simple question:
            what can I do to help? Distilled within this question is the spirit of service and the promotion of
            the well-being of others, which Lewis (2012) identifies as servant leadership.
            These principles and questions have guided me throughout my experiences. To date, I
            have spent over 4,000 hours of service to organizations. Currently, I serve as the Co-chair of The
            Student Advocacy Committee of the International Society of Neurofeedback and Research, a
            position I have held since 2014. Additionally, I serve as a member of the second-year leadership
            circle of the Neuroscience Task Force of the American Mental Health Counselors Association;
            Editorial Assistant for Counseling Outcome Research and Evaluation, a publication of The
            Association for Assessment and Research in Counseling; Northwestern Regional Legislative
            Contact for the Mississippi Counseling Association; and, the Vice-President of the Epsilon Mu
            chapter of Chi Sigma Iota.</p>

          <h3><span>Client-Based Leadership and Advocacy</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>However, leadership and advocacy are not simply about service to our profession.
            Toporek and Daniels (2018) identify that advocacy occurs when counselors recognize and
            appropriately intervene in partnership with, or on behalf of, the clients that we serve at the
            individual, community, and/or public arena levels to overcome oppressive barriers. Advocacy is
            an integral part of the work that we train our students to do each and every time they sit across
            from the clients that they serve. This belief stems from experiences I gained when I was 14 years
            of age and employed as a bagger at my local grocery store. Late one night a customer requested
            assistance in carrying 2 boxes of red wine and a pot of flowers to her car. Per my usual script, I
            asked her: how is your day going so far? Immediately she began to cry and tell me about her plan
            to attempt suicide via alcohol poisoning. Upon hearing this, I was petrified by fear. However,
            over the next hour and a half I listened to her story and found myself instinctively nurturing
            seeds of hope that she once buried and left behind. These were seeds of: creativity, which she
            utilized to overcome adversity associated with the decline in her ability to hear; love, for her
            daughter; and resiliency, in being able to overcome an economically disadvantaged childhood to
            earn her MBA. As our conversation continued, it became apparent that her spirits began to lift
            and hope began to grow. At this point I asked her to promise me that she would stay safe and
            come back to the store in the future to touch base with me. She agreed, left with a rediscovered
            sense of hope and a promise that was sealed with a warm hug of gratitude.
            I will often tell this story when teaching about crisis because this experience taught me
            that advocacy is not simply about connecting clients with various resources or talking to our
            legislators, it is about our presence and our care. Every time we genuinely reflect a feeling, we
            advocate for the validity of that experience. When we simply hold the space, we promote an
            environment of support.
            As counselors we have the privilege of advocating with and on behalf of communities
            through a variety of methods, some of which include needs assessments and/or program
            evaluations. Thomas et. al (2018) identified that evaluators promote social justice when they
            become aware of their own biases and prejudices, explore the core components of a problem
            rather than the manifestations of the problem, and recognize ways which groups establish
            dominance (socially, politically, financially, etc.) over other groups. Upon taking these steps,
            counselors who operate through the role of an evaluator are able to promote social justice and
            decrease the disparity between marginalizing forces and those who are becoming marginalized.
            Additionally, as an aspiring counselor educator, I aim to serve our community through the
            training of highly-qualified and competent counselors. It is through my passion for the
            counseling profession that I hope to inspire counselors to practice wellness for themselves and
            with the clients that they serve whilst addressing the client’s goals for counseling.
            At the public level, we advocate by maintaining membership with The American
            Counseling Association and taking an active role to speak with our legislators about issues which
            impede individuals from accessing services to mental healthcare. One example of this is the
            Mental Health Access Improvement Act (S. 286/H.R. 945) which would allow counselors to bill
            Medicare. If passed, counselors would be able to provide services to individuals who would
            otherwise be unable to afford traditional costs of counseling services. Legislation such as this,
            reminds us that counseling is a privilege that not all individuals have the ability to afford.
            To me, advocacy is not an action which we learn, it is the process which unfolds when
            we care enough to grow alongside our clients, students, colleagues, and communities. As such, it
            is my belief that the roles of leader and advocate, which are core components of my counselor
            educator identity, would be incomplete without the guiding spirit of servitude.</p>
