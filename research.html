          <h2>Research</h2>
          <p>It is my belief that research is the voice of our profession. Research is conducted in a
            style which simultaneously serves the function of advancing the counseling profession whilst
            honoring those whom we serve. As such, it is my belief that research, especially that which is
            driven by clinical practice and is rooted in ethical principles, is one of the most crucial
            components of our profession. Furthermore, it is my belief that research should promote social
            justice. This inherently occurs as we decrease the disparity between clients who have resources
            to take part in counseling and those who do not. All too-often, many of us within the profession
            forget that counseling is a privilege. Often times, those who can gain the most from this
            additional support cannot afford the costs demanded of them. As such, we address a need in our
            community when we conduct research which provides those who cannot afford the luxury of
            counseling with free or a reduction to the cost of services.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            Furthermore, their voice, which is present in both quantitative and qualitative
            methodologies, establishes a platform of advocacy and assists in stamping-out stigma which
            adversely effects mental health. Principles of social justice and equity do not stop when we
            receive notification of acceptance for publication. It is my belief that publication is only part of
            this process. The next stage is to share this information with our colleagues through
            presentations. While presenting, we invite feedback and exert a challenge to our colleagues to
            carry the torch forward by providing services to additional populations. Additionally, we
            challenge our colleagues to evaluate the efficacy of our approach while providing services to
            individuals/groups which have a unique set of needs and worldviews. Ultimately, research
            informs our practice, establishes the foundation for our presentations/teachings, and informs
            policies which govern our collective livelihood.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Research Agenda</h2>
            <p>
              My research agenda builds upon my previously conducted research, which largely
              encompasses the use of neuroscience as a tool utilized by counselors to promote client growth.
              The goal of this research is two-fold; firstly, to explore the use of neuroscience as a tool which
              further validates the practice of counseling and; secondly, to explore the efficacy of
              neurofeedback in the treatment of clientsâ€™ brain-based clinical goals. Acquisition of grants and
              alternative sources of funding are paramount to the development of this research track. This
              technology will also assist in the development of a neurofeedback training program as well as
              assist in addressing programmatic standards. Given the recognition that clinical research is
              oftentimes costly and time consuming, I will actively pursue additional approaches to advance
              our profession such as the use of neuroscience-related meta-analyses. These analyses will further
              inform future research practices by identifying populations which have not been addressed by
              previous research and address the evidence-basis for the use of neuroscience-informed practices.
