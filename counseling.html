          <h2>Statement of Counseling Theory</h2>
          <h3><span>Integrative Neurotherapy</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>I believe that counseling promotes changes in the brain. Each time we learn something
            new, we create a new connection within our brain. Conversely, when we introduce toxins to our
            brain such as chronic stress, alcohol, or inadequate sleep, we damage these neurons and impede
            connections from being made. As such, my predominant theoretical orientation would be
            identified as integrative neurotherapy. This theoretical orientation builds upon the literature basis
            in multiple fields such as: counseling, neurology, physics, advancements in medicine, and many
            other disciplines. Specifically, my views regarding this work has been influenced by counselor
            educators such as: Lori Russell-Chapin, Thom Field, Laura Jones, Eric Beeson, Raissa Miller,
            Carlos Zalaquett, Allen Ivey, and Chad Luke. I had the honor to work with a number of these
            individuals and present on our collaborative work where we created and defined the term which
            encompasses my clinical practice: integrative neurotherapy. Integrative neurotherapy is the
            umbrella term which encompasses the approaches included in Neuroscience-informed
            counseling, neurofeedback/biofeedback, and adjunctive therapies or lifestyle changes which
            impact neural health (Field et al., 2019).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="article">
          <h3><span>Neuroscience-Informed Counseling</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>Neuroscience-informed counseling comprises of a series of psychoeducational
            tools/techniques which empower the individual, or group, to increase their level of awareness
            about how their lifestyle can promote or diminish their interpersonal, emotional, and cognitive
            functioning. It is not uncommon for a counselor who is utilizing this approach to talk with the
            client(s) about the healthy mind platter, the diathesis stress model, the hand brain model, or the
            normal stress response. The healthy mind platter discusses ways that our brain changes as we
            engage in 7 areas: time in, downtime, physical time, connection time, sleep time, play time, and
            focus time (Rock et al., 2012). Although, as many of us as counselors are well aware, these
            topics are not new. Meyers et al. (2000) defined wellness “as a way of life oriented toward
            optimal health and well-being in which body, mind, and spirit are integrated by the individual to
            live more fully within the human and natural community”. As such, one function of
            neuroscience-informed counseling is to validate wellness through the discussion of
            neurophysiological underpinnings associated with a healthy life balance.
            From a practical standpoint, in my present work with college students, I often hear
            students present to counseling with the goal of decreasing the frequency and intensity of panic
            attacks. The first step in any approach would be to build and maintain rapport. Often times the
            second session is when we begin work. From a neuroscience-informed counseling perspective,
            we will collaboratively explore how they spend their time in terms of the healthy mind platter.
            This will provide a framework of their strengths and areas that we can collaboratively explore in
            sessions. I also have had the privilege to work with individuals with severe intellectual and/or
            developmental disabilities at a state-operated, residential facility. In this role, I was able to assist
            individuals who predominately communicated via their behaviors. As such, to empower a
            mindful approach, we played the game I Spy. This approach encouraged the individuals to
            enhance the period of time they spend focusing as well as being mindful of their environment.
            The exciting part about this was that the rate of violent behaviors (hitting, scratching, and
            slapping) decreased for individuals who spent 20 minutes of the day playing I Spy.

          <h3><span>Biofeedback and Neurofeedback</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>Biofeedback and neurofeedback are areas which are not new to the counseling
            profession. Danskin and Walters (1973) were the first advocates within the counseling profession
            to discuss biofeedback as a tool which addresses clinical goals through physiological regulation.
            Building upon this literature, Sarnoff (1982) advocated for the use of EEG biofeedback to
            promote client relaxation. Meyers and Young (2012) also advocated for the use of
            neurofeedback, also known as eeg biofeedback, as a tool which counselors should consider using
            in their practice. Both of these modalities empower individuals to become aware of the messages
            that their bodies are telling them and to be able to create changes which address their clinical
            concerns. Coming from the lens of neurofeedback, we are able to conceptualize clients in terms
            of: 1) too much EEG activity in a particular region of the brain; 2) too little EEG activity or; 3)
            portions of the brain are experiencing difficulties in terms of communication (too much or too
            little communication). From this perspective, we might notice that excessive high-frequency beta
            wave activity in a particular region of the brain could be associated with anxiety (Dreis et al.,
            2015). We also might note that there is excessive alpha asymmetry in the frontal lobe of the brain
            which might facilitate negative ruminative behaviors associated with depression (Baehr et al.,
            1997). However, prior to jumping to a protocol, it is important to first complete a brain map,
            which is a form of a quantitative electroencephalogram (QEEG). The brain map allows us to
            compare electrical activity that our client’s brain makes to individuals in similar groups based on
            factors such as: age, handedness, and sex (Longo and Russo, 2016, pp. 99-101). Through this
            comparative process, we are able to identify what too much or too little really means. We then
            will pair these analyses with the symptoms the individual wishes to work on. It is important to
            note that nothing goes into the brain in a neurofeedback or biofeedback session; however, these
            sessions allow the individual to learn ways to create changes in their physiology to address their
            clinical goals (Russo and Novian, 2014).</p>

        <div class="article">
          <h3><span>Adjunctive Therapies</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>The third and final approach in integrative neurotherapy is adjunctive therapies.
            Adjunctive therapies could include the use of vitamins/supplements to promote an increase in
            nutritional absorption. Included in this category might be referrals for nutritionists, physicians,
            and various forms of exercise (gyms, yoga studios, and/or personal trainers). An important first
            step with this approach would be to refer the client to a physician to complete bloodwork which
            explores client hormonal and nutritional levels. This can be powerful in the conceptualization
            process and provide information about possible nutritional deficits which might impact the
            individual’s mood. Fontani et al. (2005), found that use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
            aid in the reduction of anxiety, sadness, and anger whilst increasing vigor.</p>

          <h3><span>Clinical Experiences</span></h3>
          <div class="clr"></div>
          <p>The use of integrative neurotherapy has been informed by my practice in a variety of
            settings including: psychiatric in-patient hospitals, non-profit, private practice, school-based
            therapy, university counseling centers, as well as a state-run facility for individuals with
            intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. I have found that in each of these environments
            that the use of neuroscience-informed counseling and adjunctive therapies have been welcomed
            and encouraged. However, neurofeedback/biofeedback has its own limitations due to insurance
            reimbursement and costs. These experiences inform my current practice as well as serve an
            integral role in my teachings, research, leadership and advocacy. In nearly every avenue of
            counseling, I have found that there is a neurophysiological basis or approach which informs
            clients about the merits of wellness and assists them in identifying and creating changes which
            promote their growth.</p>
